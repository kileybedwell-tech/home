# Project notes

- The user (Kiley) is in the Pacific time zone (PST/PDT). When time of day
  matters — greetings, assumptions about whether it's late, etc. — check the
  actual current time (e.g. `TZ='America/Los_Angeles' date`) rather than
  guessing from earlier context in the conversation.

- This repo contains `ebay/`, a working CLI already connected to Kiley's real
  eBay seller account (credentials and network access are provisioned for
  this environment — `python -m ebay status` confirms the connection with no
  setup needed). It manages live inventory: real listings, real money.

  When Kiley sends photos of an item to list:
  1. **Before drafting anything, run `python -m ebay listings --with-offers`**
     to see what's already live. Check the photographed item against it —
     Kiley has been burned before by a session that didn't know to check and
     risked a duplicate listing. If it looks like a possible match, say so
     and ask rather than silently drafting a duplicate or silently assuming
     it's new.
  2. Draft the listing (title, description, condition, item specifics,
     category via `python -m ebay categories "..."`) and show it to Kiley
     before creating anything.
  3. Create as a **draft**, not published (`create ... --draft`), using
     `--photo` for local image files. Never pass `--dry-run` when Kiley
     actually wants it created — that flag only previews the payload and
     creates nothing.
  4. Publishing is a separate, deliberate step Kiley approves explicitly
     (`python -m ebay pending` to see what's queued, `python -m ebay publish`
     to go live). Don't publish without that explicit go-ahead.

  See `README.md` in this repo for the full command reference.
